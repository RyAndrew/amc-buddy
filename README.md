Amcrest cameras have many features but not the best UI.
This project aims to use the various features to build a more useful UI.

On camera AI triggers emails to be send to gmail with a jpg image attached.
This application downloads the emails and attachments saving the photos locally and storing the events into a sqlite database.
Thumbnails are auto generated from the images.
